# [Discovery] EPIC-006: Discovery & Intelligence Infrastructure

## Why This Matters

WhisperSync accumulates thousands of voice transcripts containing invaluable patterns about user behavior, preferences, and growth. Without discovery infrastructure, these insights remain buried in isolated S3 objects. The Discovery & Intelligence system transforms raw transcripts into:

- **Behavioral Insights**: "You're 3x more productive on Tuesdays"
- **Emerging Patterns**: "Family mentions increased 40% this month"  
- **Predictive Suggestions**: "Based on your patterns, schedule deep work before 10 AM"
- **Cross-Agent Learning**: Connect dots between work stress and personal memories

This infrastructure is the foundation for WhisperSync's evolution from a reactive tool to a proactive cognitive companion.

### Search Infrastructure Design

#### OpenSearch Implementation
```python
class DiscoveryEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.opensearch = OpenSearchClient()
        self.vector_store = Pinecone()
        self.graph_db = NeptuneClient()
        
    async def hybrid_search(self, query: str, filters: dict = None):
        """Combine keyword and semantic search."""
        # Keyword search in OpenSearch
        keyword_results = await self.opensearch.search(
            index="transcripts",
            body={
                "query": {
                    "multi_match": {
                        "query": query,
                        "fields": ["content^2", "summary", "themes"]
                    }
                },
                "aggs": {
                    "emotions": {"terms": {"field": "emotion"}},
                    "agents": {"terms": {"field": "agent_type"}},
                    "dates": {"date_histogram": {"field": "timestamp"}}
                }
            }
        )
        
        # Semantic search in vector store
        embedding = await self.generate_embedding(query)
        semantic_results = await self.vector_store.query(
            vector=embedding,
            top_k=20,
            filter=filters
        )
        
        # Merge and re-rank results
        return self.merge_results(keyword_results, semantic_results)
```

### Pattern Detection Algorithms

```python
class PatternDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.algorithms = {
            'frequency': FrequencyAnalyzer(),
            'anomaly': IsolationForest(),
            'trend': ProphetForecaster(),
            'correlation': CorrelationMatrix()
        }
    
    def detect_patterns(self, time_window: str = '30d'):
        patterns = []
        
        # Frequency patterns
        patterns.extend(
            self.find_recurring_themes(time_window)
        )
        
        # Behavioral anomalies
        patterns.extend(
            self.detect_anomalies(time_window)
        )
        
        # Trend analysis
        patterns.extend(
            self.analyze_trends(time_window)
        )
        
        # Cross-agent correlations
        patterns.extend(
            self.find_correlations()
        )
        
        return self.rank_patterns_by_significance(patterns)
    
    def find_recurring_themes(self, window: str):
        """Identify topics that appear regularly."""
        return self.algorithms['frequency'].analyze(
            data=self.load_transcripts(window),
            min_frequency=3,
            min_confidence=0.7
        )
```

### Knowledge Graph Schema

```cypher
// Entities
CREATE (u:User {id: 'user_123', name: 'William'})
CREATE (m:Memory {id: 'mem_456', content: '...', emotion: 'nostalgic'})
CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Dad', relationship: 'father'})
CREATE (proj:Project {name: 'habit-tracker', type: 'github'})
CREATE (t:Theme {name: 'family', category: 'personal'})

// Relationships
CREATE (u)-[:CREATED]->(m)
CREATE (m)-[:MENTIONS]->(p)
CREATE (m)-[:OCCURRED_AT]->(time:TimePoint {date: '2024-01-15'})
CREATE (m)-[:HAS_THEME]->(t)
CREATE (u)-[:WORKING_ON]->(proj)
CREATE (proj)-[:INSPIRED_BY]->(m)

// Queries
// Find all memories about family from last month
MATCH (u:User)-[:CREATED]->(m:Memory)-[:HAS_THEME]->(t:Theme {name: 'family'})
WHERE m.timestamp > datetime() - duration('P30D')
RETURN m ORDER BY m.timestamp DESC

// Find connections between work stress and family memories
MATCH (work:Memory)-[:HAS_THEME]->(stress:Theme {name: 'stress'}),
      (work)-[:OCCURRED_AT]->(t1:TimePoint),
      (family:Memory)-[:HAS_THEME]->(fam:Theme {name: 'family'}),
      (family)-[:OCCURRED_AT]->(t2:TimePoint)
WHERE abs(duration.between(t1.date, t2.date).days) < 2
RETURN work, family, t1, t2
```

### Analytics Pipeline

```python
class AnalyticsPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("WhisperSync").getOrCreate()
        
    def daily_aggregation(self, date: str):
        """Compute daily metrics."""
        df = self.spark.read.parquet(f"s3://data-lake/transcripts/{date}")
        
        metrics = {
            'total_transcripts': df.count(),
            'unique_themes': df.select('themes').distinct().count(),
            'emotion_distribution': df.groupBy('emotion').count().collect(),
            'agent_usage': df.groupBy('agent_type').count().collect(),
            'avg_sentiment': df.agg({'sentiment_score': 'avg'}).collect()[0][0]
        }
        
        # Pattern detection
        patterns = self.detect_daily_patterns(df)
        
        # Write results
        self.write_metrics(date, metrics, patterns)
```

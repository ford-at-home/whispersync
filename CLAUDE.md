# WhisperSync - Cognitive Second Brain Foundation

## Quick Start Summary

WhisperSync is evolving from a **voice-to-action pipeline** into a **cognitive second brain** with semantic understanding, knowledge graphs, and intelligent memory. Record a memo ‚Üí Semantic processing ‚Üí Knowledge storage ‚Üí Intelligent retrieval & action.

### üöß **SYSTEM STATUS: FOUNDATION REFACTOR IN PROGRESS**
‚úÖ **EPIC-001 Created** - Cognitive Second Brain Foundation architecture  
‚úÖ **Issue Audit Complete** - 7 obsolete issues closed, dependencies updated  
üîÑ **Phase 1 Implementation** - Vector storage, semantic parsing, hybrid search  
‚è≥ **Foundation Dependent** - 19 enhanced issues waiting for cognitive foundation

### WHY THIS DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**Local-First Development**: The entire pipeline can be tested without AWS infrastructure, enabling rapid iteration.

**Test-Driven Agents**: Each agent has comprehensive unit tests because voice transcripts are unpredictable.

**Infrastructure as Code**: CDK ensures reproducible deployments and environment parity.

**Observability First**: OpenTelemetry tracing is built-in because distributed agent systems are hard to debug.

**New Cognitive Workflow:**
1. Record voice memo on iPhone (any location, any topic)
2. Semantic parsing extracts entities, relationships, and context  
3. Multi-store architecture: Vector DB (embeddings) + Knowledge Graph (relationships) + Document Store (structured data)
4. Cognitive router intelligently selects agents based on semantic understanding
5. Agents access rich context and knowledge for intelligent responses

## New Cognitive Architecture

```
iPhone ‚Üí Semantic Parser ‚Üí Multi-Store ‚Üí Cognitive Router ‚Üí Enhanced Agents ‚Üí Intelligent Action
         (Whisper + NLP)   (Vector DB +    (Context-Aware    (Knowledge-Rich)
                           Knowledge Graph) Classification)
```

### WHY THE COGNITIVE FOUNDATION APPROACH

**Semantic Understanding**: Extract meaning, not just words - understand intent, context, and relationships.

**Knowledge Accumulation**: Build rich knowledge graphs that connect ideas across time and domains.

**Intelligent Routing**: Route based on semantic understanding, not folder structure.

**Enhanced Agents**: Agents with access to full context and historical knowledge.

**Future-Proof Architecture**: Foundation supports advanced AI capabilities like reasoning and planning.

- **Document Store**: MongoDB/DynamoDB for structured transcript data
- **Semantic Parser**: Claude-powered NLP pipeline for entity extraction
- **Cognitive Router**: Context-aware agent selection and routing

- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration for tracing and monitoring
- **Demo UI**: Streamlit app for testing the pipeline

## Important Code Locations

### WHY THIS DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

**Agents Separation**: Each agent is a standalone module for independent development and testing.

**Lambda Function Isolation**: Single-purpose function in dedicated directory for clear deployment boundaries.

**Infrastructure Code Separation**: CDK stacks separate from application logic for DevOps clarity.

**Local Development Tools**: `mac-to-s3/` and `demo/` enable development without cloud dependencies.

**Test Organization**: Unit and integration tests separated for different execution contexts.

- **Agents**: `agents/` - Contains the three agent implementations
- **Lambda**: `lambda_fn/router_handler.py` - Routes S3 events to agents
- **Infrastructure**: `infrastructure/mcp_stack.py` - AWS CDK stack
- **Local Transcription**: `mac-to-s3/` - Whisper transcription pipeline
- **Tests**: `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- **Demo**: `demo/app.py` - Streamlit UI for testing

```

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Agent Routing**: Agent name extracted from S3 key path (e.g., `transcripts/work/...` ‚Üí `work_agent`)

2. **Agent Inputs**: All agents receive:
   - `transcript`: The transcribed text
   - `s3_key`: Original S3 key for context
   - `bucket`: S3 bucket name

3. **Agent Outputs**: Written to `s3://voice-mcp/outputs/{agent}/{date}_response.json`

4. **Secrets**: GitHub token stored in AWS Secrets Manager as `github/personal_token`

5. **Strands Import Pattern**:
   - `from strands import Agent, tool` - For agent class and decorators
   - `from strands_sdk import invoke_agent, register_agent` - For SDK operations
   - `from strands_tools import bedrock_knowledge_base_retrieve` - For tool integrations

## Resolved Issues & Updates

1. **‚úÖ Lambda Path**: Infrastructure correctly references `lambda_fn/` directory
2. **‚úÖ Strands SDK**: Mock implementations created for missing Strands SDK dependencies
3. **‚úÖ Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry added for distributed tracing and observability
4. **‚úÖ Demo UI**: Streamlit app provides visual testing interface
5. **‚úÖ Virtual Environment**: Project uses `.venv` for dependency isolation
6. **‚úÖ Code Quality**: Black and flake8 configured for consistent formatting
7. **‚úÖ Orchestrator Found**: The orchestrator agent exists and is fully implemented
8. **‚úÖ Mock Agent Tools**: Created `agent_tools.py` with mock implementations for testing
9. **‚úÖ Import Issues Fixed**: Updated orchestrator to gracefully handle missing Strands SDK

## Sprint 1 Achievements ‚úÖ

3. **Theory of Mind**: Implement learning and personalization
4. **Persona Voices**: Add the 4 AI personality voices
5. **Performance Optimization**: Scale for production usage

## Agent-Specific Notes

### Work Journal Agent
- Appends to weekly logs: `work/weekly_logs/{year}-W{week}.md`
- Each entry includes ISO-8601 timestamp
- TODO: Add Claude for weekly summaries

### Memory Agent
- Stores as JSONL in `memories/{date}.jsonl`
- Schema: `{timestamp, content, sentiment, themes, people}`
- TODO: Implement sentiment analysis

### GitHub Idea Agent
- Creates public repos by default
- Generates repo name from idea content
- Stores history in `github/history.jsonl`
- Requires GitHub PAT in Secrets Manager

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each agent in isolation with mock S3/GitHub
2. **Integration Tests**: Test full pipeline with real AWS resources
3. **Local Runner**: Mimics Lambda execution for rapid development

## Philosophy & Vision

This isn't just a transcription tool - it's a "cognitive exoskeleton" for capturing and acting on thoughts. The friction-free capture (just speak) combined with intelligent routing makes it powerful for:
- Maintaining work journals without typing
- Preserving personal memories with context
- Turning shower thoughts into GitHub projects

Future extensions could include:
- Dream journal agent
- Task/TODO agent
- Family update agent
- Learning notes agent

## Quick Fixes & Common Issues

1. **S3 Permissions**: Lambda needs `s3:GetObject` and `s3:PutObject`
2. **Strands Registration**: Run `scripts/register_agents.py` after deployment
3. **Local Testing**: Use `test_data/` directory structure matching S3
4. **GitHub Token**: Must have `repo` scope for creating repositories

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to agents in `agents/`
2. Run unit tests: `pytest tests/unit/test_{agent}.py`
3. Test locally: `python local_test_runner.py test_data/transcripts/{agent}/test.txt`
4. Run integration tests if touching infrastructure
5. Deploy with CDK if infrastructure changed
6. Monitor CloudWatch logs for Lambda execution

Remember: The goal is frictionless thought capture with intelligent automation. Keep the recording ‚Üí action pipeline as simple as possible.

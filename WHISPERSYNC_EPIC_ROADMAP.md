- Mobile capture adoption: 80% of users

### Key Features
1. **Direct iPhone ‚Üí S3 Upload** via iOS Shortcuts
2. **Cloud Transcription Service** (Whisper API or AWS Transcribe)
3. **Offline Recording Queue** with automatic sync
4. **Post-Recording Classification** (record first, organize later)
5. **Push Notifications** for processing status

### User Stories
- As a user walking in nature, I want to record thoughts without worrying about WiFi
- As a busy professional, I want instant capture without desktop dependency
- As a parent, I want to capture memories immediately without setup

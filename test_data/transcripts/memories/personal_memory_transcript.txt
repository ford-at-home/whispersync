I was just looking at some old photos and came across the picture from my college graduation. It brought back such vivid memories of that day - the mixture of excitement, relief, and uncertainty about the future.

I remember my parents being so proud. Dad had tears in his eyes when I walked across the stage, which was rare for him. Mom was taking pictures non-stop and kept saying how she couldn't believe her baby was all grown up. My younger sister was there too, looking bored in her teenager way but secretly proud.

What I remember most is the feeling of possibility. I had my computer science degree, but I had no idea what I wanted to do with it. I was terrified and thrilled at the same time. I kept thinking about all the things I wanted to build, all the problems I wanted to solve.

The funny thing is, I was so worried about not knowing exactly what I wanted to do. Now, ten years later, I realize that uncertainty was actually a gift. It meant I was open to opportunities I never would have considered if I had been too rigid about my plans.

I think about that version of myself sometimes - so eager, so nervous, so full of dreams. In some ways, I miss that pure excitement about the unknown. But I'm also grateful for the confidence and skills I've built over the years.

That graduation day was really the beginning of everything. My first job, meeting my partner, moving to this city, all the friends I've made, the projects I've worked on - it all started with that step across the stage.

I should call my parents tonight and tell them I was thinking about that day. They'd love to hear that.

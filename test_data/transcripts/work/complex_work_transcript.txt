Today I had a very productive day working on the microservices architecture migration. I spent the morning reviewing the current monolithic application and identifying service boundaries. The main challenges were around data consistency and transaction management across services.

I implemented the user authentication service using JWT tokens and integrated it with our existing user database. The OAuth 2.0 flow is now working correctly with Google and GitHub providers. I also set up the API gateway with rate limiting and request validation.

In the afternoon, I worked on the order processing service. This involved implementing event sourcing patterns and setting up RabbitMQ for asynchronous message handling. The service now publishes order events that other services can consume.

I had a code review session with the team where we discussed the new architecture. Sarah raised some good questions about service discovery and load balancing. We decided to use Consul for service discovery and implement circuit breakers for resilience.

The deployment pipeline is almost ready. I configured Docker containers for each service and set up Kubernetes manifests. The automated testing includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. We're planning to deploy to staging environment next week.

Key metrics for today:
- 8 hours of development work
- 3 services implemented
- 12 unit tests added
- 2 integration tests created
- 1 architecture review completed

Next steps:
- Implement notification service
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Performance testing
- Documentation updates

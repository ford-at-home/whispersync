## 🔧 Ready for Production Use

### How to Use Your WhisperSync System

1. **Upload voice transcripts** to S3 bucket in these folders:
   - `transcripts/work/` → Creates work journal entries
   - `transcripts/memories/` → Preserves personal memories  
   - `transcripts/github_ideas/` → Creates GitHub repositories

2. **Processing happens automatically** via Lambda triggers

3. **Results stored in** `outputs/` prefix with full metadata

4. **Monitor via** CloudWatch dashboard and logs

### Next Steps for You

1. **Update GitHub Token**: Replace placeholder in Secrets Manager
2. **Test with Real Data**: Upload voice transcripts to test pipeline  
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check CloudWatch for processing metrics
4. **Provide Feedback**: Share what works and what needs improvement

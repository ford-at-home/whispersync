# WhisperSync Migration to UV Notes

## Date: 2025-07-02

### Successfully Migrated
- Created new virtual environment using `uv venv`
- Installed all publicly available dependencies from PyPI
- Created lock file (`requirements-lock.txt`) for reproducible builds

### Known Issues
The following packages could not be installed as they are not available in public PyPI:
- `strands>=0.1.0`
- `strands-agents>=0.1.0`
- `strands-tools>=0.1.0`

These appear to be AWS-specific packages for the Strands agent orchestration system. They may need to be:
1. Installed from a private PyPI repository
2. Installed directly from AWS sources
3. Replaced with alternative packages

### Files Created
- `requirements-available.txt` - Contains only packages available in public PyPI
- `requirements-lock.txt` - Lock file for installed packages
- `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` - This file

### Next Steps
To fully complete the migration, you'll need to:
1. Determine how to install the strands packages (check AWS documentation)
2. Update the installation process for these specific packages
3. Test that all functionality works with the new uv setup

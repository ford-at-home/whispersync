# Voice Memo Transcription Pipeline (macOS)

This folder contains a fully automated pipeline for transcribing voice memos recorded on your iPhone or Mac, storing the outputs, and syncing them to the cloud.

## What It Does

When you drop `.m4a` files (like voice memos) onto the appropriate folder or run the associated Automator workflow, this system:

1. **Transcribes** the audio using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
2. **Stores** the plain-text transcripts in `~/Documents/transcriptions/output`
3. **Logs** each run into a **timestamped log folder** inside `~/Documents/transcriptions/logs/`
4. **Uploads** the `.txt` files to your designated S3 bucket under a date-organized path

Thereâ€™s also a symlinked `Recordings/` folder in here that points directly to your system's internal Voice Memos folder for quick access.

## Why This Exists

This system was built to remove friction from the process of capturing and revisiting voice memos. Whether youâ€™re journaling, capturing podcast ideas, or dictating drafts, this setup turns raw audio into searchable, timestamped transcripts â€” automatically.

By linking to your Apple Voice Memos folder and centralizing outputs and logs in one place, the workflow becomes clean, inspectable, and extensible.

## Setup Details

- Logs are written per run to `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/`
- Transcripts go to `output/`
- Original recordings can be accessed via `Recordings/` (symlink to Apple's internal folder)
- All `.log` files are set to open in Atom for quick review
- Transcripts are uploaded to `s3://macbook-transcriptions/transcripts/{date}/{filename}.txt`

# WhisperSync v2 - User Experience Design

## Executive Summary

WhisperSync v2 evolves from a simple voice-to-action pipeline into an emotionally intelligent cognitive exoskeleton with persona-based outputs. This design maintains the core philosophy of frictionless capture while adding meaningful, personalized feedback through four distinct AI personas.

## System Overview

### Core Memory Buckets
1. **Idea** → GitHubAgent (repository creation)
2. **Tactical** → ExecutiveAgent (productivity insights, theory-of-mind)
3. **Personal** → SpiritualAgent/Diary (memories, emotional preservation)

### Persona Output Layer (ElevenLabs Voices)
1. **British Guardian** - Morning/evening summaries
2. **Indian Mystic** - Emotional/diary reflections
3. **Southern Sage** - Value-based nudges
4. **The Challenger** - Calls out contradictions

## User Journey Maps

### Journey 1: Idea Capture → GitHub Repository

**User Context**: Walking, driving, or shower thoughts about a new project

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Voice Memo: "I have an idea..."] --> B[Whisper Transcription]
    B --> C[Idea Bucket Classification]
    C --> D[GitHubAgent Processing]
    D --> E[Repository Created]
    E --> F[British Guardian Confirmation]
    F --> G[Evening Summary Mention]
```

**Touchpoints**:
1. **Capture** (0-5 seconds)
   - Natural speech, no structure required
   - Example: "What if we built an app that..."

2. **Processing** (5-30 seconds)
   - Silent background processing
   - No user intervention needed

3. **Confirmation** (30-60 seconds)
   - British Guardian: "Brilliant! I've created 'smart-water-tracker' repository with initial structure and roadmap."
   - Tone: Professional, encouraging, efficient

4. **Evening Summary** (End of day)
   - British Guardian: "Today you birthed 3 new ideas. The water tracker shows particular promise..."

**Friction Points Eliminated**:
- No app switching
- No manual repo setup
- No README writing
- No initial planning paralysis

# WhisperSync v2 System Overview

## Executive Summary

WhisperSync v2 is a voice-to-action AI platform that transforms spoken thoughts into intelligent actions through specialized agents and personalized voice responses. The system classifies voice memos into three buckets (Ideas, Tactical, Personal), routes them to appropriate agents, maintains an evolving Theory of Mind, and responds through four distinct AI personas.

## Core Philosophy

**Cognitive Exoskeleton**: WhisperSync amplifies human thought by:
- Removing friction between insight and action
- Preserving emotional and contextual richness
- Learning patterns without being prescriptive
- Providing gentle guidance aligned with personal values

## System Architecture

### 1. Input Layer
- **Voice Capture**: iPhone Voice Memos app
- **Transcription**: Local Whisper for privacy
- **Upload**: S3 with event triggers

### 2. Classification Layer
- **AI Classifier**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Buckets**: Ideas, Tactical, Personal
- **Confidence Scoring**: Routes to review queue if uncertain

### 3. Agent Processing Layer

#### GitHubAgent (Ideas)
- Creates full GitHub repositories
- Generates project structure with code
- Adds issues for implementation
- Learns from project success patterns

#### ExecutiveAgent (Tactical)
- Maintains Theory of Mind
- Tracks productivity patterns
- Evolves knowledge categories
- Generates strategic insights

#### SpiritualAgent (Personal)
- Preserves memories with emotion
- Extracts people, places, themes
- Creates searchable life archive
- Enables periodic life reviews

### 4. Persona Output Layer

#### Voice Personas
1. **British Guardian**: Professional summaries
2. **Indian Mystic**: Emotional reflections  
3. **Southern Sage**: Value-based guidance
4. **The Challenger**: Contradiction detection

#### Voice Selection Logic
- Context-aware (time, emotion, content)
- Agent preferences
- User state consideration
- Fallback mechanisms

## Data Flow

```
Voice Memo → Transcription → S3 Upload → Classification
    ↓
Bucket Assignment → SQS Queue → Agent Processing
    ↓
Theory of Mind Update → Persona Selection → Voice Synthesis
    ↓
ElevenLabs API → Audio Response → User Notification
```

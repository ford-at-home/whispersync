# üéôÔ∏è WhisperSync v2

**Voice-to-Action AI Platform with Persona Intelligence**

*Transform your voice into intelligent actions through specialized agents and personalized AI voices*

---

## üåü Overview

WhisperSync v2 evolves beyond simple transcription into a true "cognitive exoskeleton" that:

- **Classifies** every voice memo into three meaningful buckets
- **Routes** to specialized agents with distinct capabilities  
- **Learns** your patterns through evolving Theory of Mind
- **Responds** through four distinct persona voices
- **Grows** its knowledge architecture organically over time

## üì¶ Voice Memo Buckets

Every transcript is intelligently classified into one of three categories:

### 1. üí° **Idea** ‚Üí GitHubAgent
- Triggers repository creation with scaffolded code
- Generates complete project structure
- Creates GitHub issues for implementation
- Stored as "cool new idea" for portfolio tracking

### 2. üéØ **Tactical** ‚Üí ExecutiveAgent  
- Reflections on productivity, decision-making, strategy
- Updates personal Theory of Mind layer
- Categorizes into granular tags (work.product, workflow.time, personal.boundaries)
- Knowledge architecture evolves over time
- Powers daily summaries and productivity insights

### 3. üí≠ **Personal** ‚Üí SpiritualAgent (Diary)
- Memories, family moments, personal feelings
- Verbatim transcript preservation
- Rich metadata: tags, people, sentiment, significance
- No immediate actions - corpus for future reflections
- Beautiful S3 organization for life reviews

## üé≠ Persona Output Layer

Four distinct ElevenLabs voices deliver personalized responses:

### 1. üá¨üáß **The British Guardian**
- **Voice**: Chipper, informative, BBC-style
- **When**: Morning + evening summaries, task confirmations
- **Example**: "Brilliant morning! You've got three exciting projects in flight..."

### 2. üßò **The Indian Mystic**  
- **Voice**: Gentle, poetic, contemplative
- **When**: After emotionally significant events or diary-rich days
- **Example**: "Like ripples on a still pond, today's memories reveal deeper truths..."

### 3. ü§† **The Southern Sage**
- **Voice**: Gravelly, grounded, wise
- **When**: Value-based nudges before tough conversations
- **Example**: "Now hold on there, partner. Remember what your daddy used to say..."

### 4. üòà **The Challenger** (Optional)
- **Voice**: Sarcastic, combative, truth-telling
- **When**: Flags contradictions, calls out stagnation
- **Example**: "Oh, another 'revolutionary' todo app? How's the last five working out?"

## üß† Theory of Mind Evolution

The system maintains a sophisticated understanding of you that evolves over time:

```json
{
  "core_identity": {
    "values": ["innovation", "family", "growth"],
    "work_style": "deep_focus_mornings",
    "communication_preferences": "direct_authentic"
  },
  "behavioral_patterns": {
    "productivity_cycles": "peaks_at_10am",
    "stress_indicators": ["short_responses", "task_switching"],
    "decision_making": "data_driven_with_intuition"
  },
  "knowledge_graph": {
    "work.product.features": 0.85,
    "workflow.time.boundaries": 0.72,
    "personal.health.sleep": 0.68
  }
}
```

## üìö Diary Feature Specification

Personal memories are stored with rich metadata while preserving verbatim content:

```json
{
  "date": "2025-07-03",
  "tags": ["family", "Rio", "joy", "morning_ritual"],
  "people": ["Rio", "spouse"],
  "locations": ["home", "kitchen"],
  "sentiment": {
    "primary": "joy",
    "secondary": ["gratitude", "love"],
    "intensity": 0.85
  },
  "summary": "Sweet morning moment with Rio at breakfast",
  "verbatim": "Rio said the funniest thing today at breakfast...",
  "quotes": ["'Daddy, why do pancakes look like the sun?'"],
  "significance": 8,
  "growth_indicator": "presence_in_small_moments",
  "audio_url": "s3://voice-memos/2025-07-03T0812.mp3"
}
```
